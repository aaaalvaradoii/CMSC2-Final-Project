					&nbsp &nbsp The Society of Applied Mathematics of UPLB, or SAM-UP, is a duly-recognized, student academic organization based in the University of the Philippines Los Baños. The organization’s primary objective is to promote applied mathematics and its related fields to the university, and ultimately, the Philippine society.
					<br>
					<br>
					&nbsp &nbsp On November 27, 1984, 28 applied mathematics majors formed SAM-UP, in their common interests and regards. Over the course of 31 years, the Society grew to 80 batches after the founding members. Several events such as the Inter-Bloc Mathematics Quiz Contest (IBMQ), Math in Action (MIA), Numero were instituted to promote applied mathematics to the community outside the organization, among others.
